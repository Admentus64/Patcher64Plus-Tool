THE LEGEND OF ZELDA:
LINK'S AWAKENING REDUX

------------------------------------

This hack combines three of the most essential improvement hacks out there, and also implementing full uncensorship for Link's Awakening DX to make the experience of the game much more enjoyable and without the annoyances of the original.

So what does this hack do specifically?


* Sprite and text uncensoring:
	- All sprites that were censored from the Japanese release have been restored
	- All text related to the censorship has been restored as well

* Restore the low health beeping (Optional):
	NOTE: There's two patches for this. One that says "Normal Redux ONLY" and another that says "Font Improvement ONLY".
	- Normal Redux ONLY: Apply this patch only if you will be using Redux normally WITHOUT the "Font Improvement" patch. Apply main Redux IPS patch first, then the "Restore Low Health Beep (Normal Redux ONLY).ips" patch secondly.
	- Font Improvement ONLY: Apply this patch only if you will be using Redux patched alongside the Font Improvement hack. Apply the "Font Improvement.ips" patch first, then the "Restore Low Health Beep (Font Improvement ONLY).ips" patch secondly.


And for the hack-specific changes:


* Link's Awakening DX VWF:
	- Introduces a Variable Width Font (VWF) that makes the text much more readable. 
	All the text is adapted to fit the space freed by the new font.
	- Removes the spaces at the end of the player’s name (if any) and fixes a couple of typos from the original game.


* Photo Album Translation:
	- Translation of the previously-untranslated Japanese present in the Photo Album.
	- Optional: Remove the Photo Album overlays, to have a clean image of each photograph.


* Quality of Life Improvements:
	- No more text when you touch certain objects. Rocks, cracked rocks, pots, ice blocks, etc.
	- Guardian Acorns and Pieces of Power are quick pickups. No more long text interrupting game play.
	- No more low health beeping.
	- Optional: Remove the THIEF photo punishment, meaning that you won't get your character named THIEF for obtaining the thief photo. The Death counter won't go up when the shopkeeper kills you for that pic as well. There's two patches for this, similar to the Low Beep one:
		o Normal Redux ONLY: Apply this patch only if you will be using Redux normally WITHOUT the "Font Improvement" patch. Apply main Redux IPS patch first, then the "Remove THIEF Photo Downsides (Normal Redux ONLY).ips" patch secondly.
		o Font Improvement ONLY: Apply this patch only if you will be using Redux patched alongside the Font Improvement hack. Apply the "Font Improvement.ips" patch first, then the "Remove THIEF Photo Downsides (Font Improvement ONLY).ips" patch secondly.

* Font Improvement (Optional):
NOTE: If you simply want a better font, but not have the Variable Width Font (VWF), then apply this patch first (don't patch the main Redux IPS)! So, if you want to use any optional patch:
Font Improvement -> Any other (Font Improvement ONLY) optional patch.
In short terms, this patch:
	- Removes VWF hack
	- Makes the font in Zelda - Link’s Awakening DX much more readable. 
	- Replaces the always-italics font from the original game with one that closely resembles the font used in the Zelda Oracles series.
